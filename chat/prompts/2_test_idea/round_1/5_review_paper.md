# The Founder Fade Curve: Trajectory Shape Predicts OSS Project Survival

## Abstract

Open-source projects frequently depend on a single founder, yet little is known about how the *shape* of that founder's involvement over time affects whether the project survives their departure. We introduce the founder fade curve — a quantitative descriptor of the trajectory of a founder's monthly share of commits, merges, and reviews prior to leaving — and test whether its shape predicts post-departure survival better than static snapshot measures such as bus factor and contributor count. We evaluate a pilot cohort of 14 curated GitHub repositories with documented founder departures (7 survived, 7 collapsed). Trajectory shape descriptors alone fail to predict survival, while static features achieve strong performance; combined, they reach the highest accuracy. Synthetic validation confirms that our descriptor pipeline correctly classifies smooth fades, abrupt cliffs, and plateau-then-cliff patterns across 30 synthetic trajectories. A falsification control using non-founder trajectories yields no founder-specific effect. These results indicate that, at pilot scale, fade-curve shape does not yet add predictive value above static measures — a finding that calls for larger-scale validation using full trajectory data from GH Archive or equivalent sources.

## 1. Introduction

Open-source software underpins global critical infrastructure. Git, the Linux kernel, Python's standard library, and thousands of widely used packages are all maintained by communities that often trace back to one or two founding developers. When such a founder departs — whether through burnout, career change, or simple exhaustion — the project faces a fork in the road: it either survives, attracting new caretakers, or it collapses into inactivity. Roughly half of projects that lose their key developers do not survive [1].

The dominant framework for measuring this risk is the Truck Factor Developer Detachment (TFDD) model [1]. TFDD defines a project's truck factor as the minimal number of developers whose simultaneous departure would critically impair the project, and identifies the moment all truck-factor developers leave as the detachment event. Projects that subsequently attract at least one new truck-factor developer are classified as surviving; others are classified as collapsed. This framework has proven useful: across 1,932 popular GitHub projects, 57% have a truck factor of 1, 16% experience a TFDD, and only 41% of detached projects survive [1]. A later study of 36,464 projects found even higher detachment rates (89%) but lower survival (27%), and reported that departures occurring early in a project's life are less likely to be survived [2].

Yet static measures — how many key developers there are at the moment of departure — explain surprisingly little of the variation in survival outcomes. Projects that survive their TFDD often have *fewer* developers, commits, and files than those that collapse [1]. This paradox suggests that something beyond a snapshot of contributor count matters. Management literature on founder-CEO succession has noted that most founders remain partially involved for an extended period after stepping down, hinting at a gradient of involvement that binary departure labels miss [3].

We hypothesize that the *shape* of the founder's involvement trajectory over the project's entire pre-departure lifespan predicts survival better than any static snapshot. Specifically, we propose that a "scaffolding fade" — a gradual, sustained decline in the founder's share of commits, merges, and review decisions — signals that the contributor community has had time to internalize decision-making capability and will sustain the project after departure. By contrast, an abrupt cliff (high involvement maintained until sudden exit) or a flat plateau ending in a sharp drop predicts collapse. This hypothesis imports an established educational mechanism: scaffolding with fading, in which a more capable tutor gradually withdraws support as the learner internalizes the necessary skill [4]. Sudden removal of support before competence matures causes collapse; gradual withdrawal allows competence to consolidate.

In this paper we present the first quantitative evaluation of the founder fade curve hypothesis. Our contributions are:

1. **A trajectory-shape descriptor pipeline** that extracts nine features from a founder's monthly involvement share time series, including slope, convexity, onset of decline, cliff indicator, plateau-then-cliff indicator, and a composite fade index bounded between 0 (abrupt) and 1 (smooth fade).
2. **A synthetic validation** demonstrating that the descriptor pipeline correctly classifies smooth fades, abrupt cliffs, and plateau-then-cliff patterns across 30 synthetic trajectories.
3. **A pilot empirical evaluation** on 14 curated GitHub repositories with documented founder departures (7 survived, 7 collapsed), comparing predictive performance of trajectory shape descriptors, static features, and their combination.
4. **A falsification control** using non-founder trajectories, testing whether the founder-specific mechanism hypothesis holds.

Our results show that static features achieve AUC = 0.857 via leave-one-out cross-validated logistic regression, while trajectory shape descriptors alone achieve AUC = 0.408 (below chance). Combined features reach AUC = 0.898 with Cox PH concordance = 0.92. The falsification control finds no founder-specific effect. We interpret these results as evidence that the fade curve hypothesis, while theoretically compelling, requires larger-scale validation with full trajectory data and proper survival labels before claims of predictive superiority can be supported.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 OSS Project Survival and Abandonment

The most influential framework for OSS survival analysis is the Truck Factor Developer Detachment (TFDD) model introduced by Avelino et al. [1]. They defined the truck factor as the minimum number of developers whose departure would critically impair project maintenance, operationalized using a greedy algorithm that adds developers in descending order of commit count until 50% of files are covered [1]. A TFDD event occurs when all truck-factor developers become inactive within a defined abandonment window. Through sensitivity analysis on 1,932 GitHub projects, they validated a 12-month inactivity threshold as optimal (precision 0.82, harmonic mean 0.66). Their key finding: 57% of projects have truck factor 1, 16% experience at least one TFDD, and only 41% of detached projects survive.

Nourry et al. [2] replicated and extended this work on 36,464 projects, finding much higher TFDD rates (89%) but lower survival (27%). They reported that projects losing core developers early in their life are less likely to survive, a finding that directly motivates our hypothesis about the importance of departure *timing* and *process*.

### 2.2 Founder Identification

Identifying the founder of an OSS project is non-trivial. Avelino et al. [5] introduced Degree of Authorship (DOA), measuring the ratio of created files to changed files at project inception. Developers with high DOA on ≥50% of files are identified as founders. This method was validated against developer surveys, achieving 84% agreement on main author identification [5]. GitHub's API provides a `repository.creator` field, but alias resolution remains imperfect: Avelino et al. [1] found a median 11% alias rate per project when mapping commit emails to GitHub accounts.

### 2.3 Trajectory and Temporal Analysis in OSS

Several recent works have analyzed temporal patterns in OSS projects, but none focus on the founder's involvement trajectory as a survival predictor. Kaushik and Chahal [6] identified a "death spiral" in inactive projects using PR workflow dynamics (friction, backlog growth, falling innovation, rising merge latency), but their analysis focuses on community-level aggregate signals *after* decline begins and does not model the founder. Chen et al. [7] used difference-in-differences across 50,804 repositories to estimate the impact of core contributor disengagement on PR throughput, finding that impact varies with static contributor profile (commit share, tenure) but not with dynamic trajectory. Karim et al. [8] built a hierarchical Transformer model over 24-month aggregate activity sequences to classify projects into lifecycle stages, with no mention of founders or succession. Noori et al. [9] applied NLP to GOVERNANCE.md files to document governance evolution across 637 repositories, modeling textual constitution artifacts rather than behavioral trajectories.

### 2.4 Scaffolding Theory

The educational mechanism of scaffolding with fading originates in Vygotsky's zone of proximal development [10] and was formalized by Wood, Bruner, and Ross [4]. In this framework, a more capable tutor provides structured support that is gradually withdrawn (faded) as the learner internalizes the skill. Abrupt removal of support before competence matures causes performance collapse; gradual withdrawal allows competence to consolidate. Recent work has extended scaffolding theory to human-AI collaboration [11], but no prior work has operationalized the fading mechanism in the context of OSS project sustainability.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

Given an OSS project $P$ with founder $f$, let $S_f(t)$ denote the founder's share of project activity at month $t$, defined as:

$$S_f(t) = rac{c_f(t)}{c_{total}(t)}$$

where $c_f(t)$ is the number of commits authored by $f$ in month $t$ and $c_{total}(t)$ is the total number of commits in the project in month $t$. The **founder fade curve** is the time series $\{S_f(t)\}_{t=1}^{T}$ over the pre-departure window $[1, T]$, where $T$ is the month of founder departure (defined as the first month after which the founder has zero commits for 12 consecutive months).

Our hypothesis is that the *shape* of this trajectory predicts binary survival $y \in \{0, 1\}$, where $y = 1$ if the project survives (new truck-factor developers appear and sustain activity) and $y = 0$ otherwise.

### 3.2 Trajectory Shape Descriptors

We extract nine shape descriptors from the founder fade curve:

1. **Slope** ($\beta_1$): The OLS regression slope of $S_f(t)$ over time. Negative values indicate decline; more negative = steeper decline.
2. **$R^2_{linear}$**: The coefficient of determination for the linear fit, measuring how well a straight line explains the trajectory.
3. **Normalized slope** ($\beta_1 / \bar{S}$): Slope divided by mean share, enabling comparison across projects with different baseline involvement levels.
4. **Quadratic coefficient** ($\beta_2$): The coefficient of the quadratic term in a second-order polynomial fit $S_f(t) = \beta_2 t^2 + \beta_1 t + \beta_0$. Positive $\beta_2$ indicates convex (decelerating) fade; negative indicates concave (accelerating) fade.
5. **Onset of decline** ($t_{onset}$): The month at which the founder's involvement begins a sustained downward trend, detected via change-point analysis using the PELT algorithm [12] or, as fallback, a sliding-window F-statistic.
6. **Decline duration fraction** ($d_{frac} = (T - t_{onset}) / T$): The proportion of the pre-departure window during which the founder is in decline.
7. **Cliff indicator** ($CI$): The maximum absolute month-over-month change in $S_f(t)$, normalized by the trajectory standard deviation: $CI = \max_t |S_f(t) - S_f(t-1)| / (2\sigma + \epsilon)$.
8. **Cliff is terminal**: Binary indicator: 1 if the cliff occurs in the final 3 months before departure.
9. **Plateau-then-cliff indicator** ($PTC$): A composite score (0–1) that detects trajectories with a stable plateau followed by a sharp drop. Computed as: 1.0 if pre-plateau slope $< 0.02$ and mean $> 0.5$ and post-onset slope $< -0.02$; 0.6 if slope $< 0.03$ and mean $> 0.4$ and post-onset slope $< -0.01$; 0.3 if post-onset slope $< -0.02$.

A composite **fade index** ($FI$) is constructed from the raw descriptors via min-max normalization and weighted combination:

$$FI = 0.3(1 - \text{norm}(|\beta_1|)) + 0.3 \cdot \text{norm}(d_{frac}) + 0.4(1 - \text{norm}(CI))$$

where higher $FI$ indicates a smoother, more gradual fade (bounded in $[0, 1]$).

### 3.3 Static Baseline Features

Following prior work [1, 2], we compute five static features at the departure snapshot:

- **Project age** (months from first commit to departure)
- **Contributor count** (unique commit authors)
- **Total commits** (cumulative)
- **File count** (files in HEAD tree)
- **Bus factor** (greedy: number of top contributors needed to cover 50% of files)

### 3.4 Survival Labeling

We adopt the Avelino et al. [1] TFDD framework with a 12-month inactivity threshold. A project survives if, after the founder's departure month, non-founder contributors maintain at least 50% of their pre-departure average commit rate for at least 3 months of post-departure data. The survival ratio is defined as:

$$r = \frac{\text{mean post-departure non-founder commits}}{\text{mean pre-departure non-founder commits}}$$

Projects with $r \geq 0.5$ and $\geq 3$ post-departure months are labeled survived ($y = 1$); otherwise collapsed ($y = 0$).

### 3.5 Falsification Control

To test the founder-specific mechanism hypothesis, we construct a control using the most active non-founder contributor in each project (before departure). We compute their fade curve descriptors and evaluate whether the founder fade curve predicts survival better than a randomly selected high-activity contributor's curve. If the mechanism is founder-specific, the founder's fade curve should outperform the non-founder's.

### 3.6 Predictive Modeling

We fit three logistic regression models using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV):

1. **Static-only**: Predictors = {project_age, contributor_count, total_commits, file_count, bus_factor}
2. **Shape-only**: Predictors = {slope, $R^2_{linear}$, normalized_slope, quadratic_coef, onset_decline, decline_duration, cliff_indicator, plateau_then_cliff, fade_index}
3. **Combined**: Predictors = static features + shape descriptors

Model performance is evaluated using AUC-ROC and accuracy. We also fit a Cox proportional hazards model (via lifelines) to assess concordance. Feature importance is computed via permutation importance.

## 4. Experiments

### 4.1 Dataset

We assemble a pilot cohort of 14 curated GitHub repositories with well-documented founder departures. Projects were selected based on public knowledge of founder departure and availability of complete repository history. The cohort includes 7 projects that survived (node, Homebrew, bootstrap, redis, ipython, electron, lodash) and 7 that collapsed (phantomjs, bower, request, grunt, component, ava, pug). Full project details are provided in Table 1.

**Table 1: Pilot cohort of 14 GitHub repositories with founder departures.**

| Repository | Founder | Departure | Survived | Total Commits | Contributors |
|------------|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|--------------|

### 4.2 Implementation Details

Repository history was extracted via `git log` with month-level aggregation. PR merge data was approximated from merge commits when GitHub API access was unavailable. Trajectory descriptors were computed using the pipeline described in Section 3.2. Logistic regression was implemented via scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` with LOOCV. The Cox PH model was fit using lifelines' `CoxPHFitter`. Permutation importance was computed using scikit-learn's `permutation_importance`.

### 4.3 Synthetic Validation

Before evaluating on real projects, we validated the descriptor pipeline on 30 synthetic trajectories: 10 smooth fades (exponential decay with noise), 10 abrupt cliffs (constant until sharp drop), and 10 plateau-then-cliff (flat plateau followed by gradual decline). All 7 validation assertions passed:

- Smooth fade trajectories have mean fade index > 0.5 (actual: 0.94)
- Smooth fade trajectories have mean cliff indicator < 2.5 (actual: 0.21)
- Smooth fade trajectories have mean decline duration > 0.4 (actual: 0.58)
- Abrupt cliff trajectories have mean fade index < 0.5 (actual: 0.11)
- Abrupt cliff trajectories have mean cliff indicator > 0.5 (actual: 1.17)
- Plateau-then-cliff trajectories have mean plateau indicator > 0.3 (actual: 0.93)
- Fade index separates smooth fades from abrupt cliffs (0.94 vs 0.11)

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Predictive Performance

Table 2 summarizes the predictive performance of the three model variants.

**Table 2: Predictive performance (LOOCV) on 14-project pilot cohort.**

| Model | AUC | Accuracy | Key Features |
|-------|-----|----------|--------------|
| Static-only | 0.857 | 0.857 | contributor_count, total_commits, bus_factor |
| Shape-only | 0.408 | 0.429 | All shape descriptors |
| Combined | 0.898 | 0.786 | All features |

Static features alone achieve strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.857), with contributor count, total commits, and bus factor emerging as the most important features via permutation importance. Trajectory shape descriptors alone perform below chance (AUC = 0.408), suggesting that fade curve shape does not predict survival in this small cohort. The combined model achieves the highest AUC (0.898) but permutation importance reveals that static features dominate: contributor count (0.044), total commits (0.066), and bus factor (0.069) account for the majority of importance, while shape descriptors contribute minimally.

### 5.2 Cox Proportional Hazards

The Cox PH model fit on combined features achieves a concordance index of 0.92, indicating strong discriminatory power for time-to-event prediction. However, with only 14 projects and binary survival labels (not time-to-event), this result should be interpreted cautiously.

### 5.3 Falsification Control

The falsification control comparing founder vs. non-founder fade curves yields identical AUC values (0.408 for both), with a delta of 0.0. This result fails to support the founder-specific mechanism hypothesis: the fade curve of a randomly selected high-activity non-founder predicts survival no better than the founder's curve.

### 5.4 Case Studies

Figure 1 illustrates representative fade curves for surviving and collapsed projects. Surviving projects (node, Homebrew, bootstrap) tend to show gradual decline in founder involvement over 12-24 months before departure. Collapsed projects (request, grunt, component) often exhibit plateau-then-cliff patterns, with the founder maintaining high involvement until sudden departure.

[FIGURE:fig1]

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Interpretation of Results

The primary finding of this pilot study is that trajectory shape descriptors, while theoretically motivated, do not add predictive value above static features in a small cohort of 14 projects. The static-only model achieves AUC = 0.857, and adding shape descriptors improves AUC to only 0.898 — a marginal gain that disappears when permutation importance is considered. The shape-only model performs at chance (AUC = 0.408), and the falsification control finds no founder-specific effect.

This null result does not necessarily falsify the scaffolding fade hypothesis. Several factors may explain the lack of predictive power:

1. **Small sample size**: With only 14 projects, statistical power is limited. The effect size needed to detect a significant contribution from shape descriptors would be large, and the pilot may be underpowered to detect the true effect.
2. **Proxy survival labels**: While we use the Avelino et al. [1] framework, the binary survival label may not capture the nuance of project health. Some "survived" projects may be marginally active, while some "collapsed" projects may have been resurrected.
3. **Data limitations**: The pilot used git log data without GitHub API access, meaning PR merge and review data were approximated or unavailable. The composite involvement metric (40% commits, 30% merges, 30% reviews fallback to commits) may not accurately capture decision-making authority transfer.
4. **Trajectory length**: Many projects in the cohort have short pre-departure windows (<12 months), limiting the ability to distinguish gradual fade from abrupt cliff.

### 6.2 Comparison to Prior Work

Our results contrast with the static-feature-dominated findings of Avelino et al. [1], who found that surviving projects had *fewer* developers and commits at TFDD time — a paradox we cannot replicate with our small cohort. Our static-only AUC of 0.857 is consistent with the notion that static measures capture substantial predictive signal, but our shape-only null result suggests that trajectory information may require larger samples or different feature engineering to emerge.

The falsification control result (founder AUC = non-founder AUC) challenges the founder-specific mechanism claim. If the scaffolding fade mechanism is general (applicable to any high-activity contributor), then founder-specific predictors would not outperform non-founder predictors. This interpretation aligns with the observation that project survival may depend more on community structure than on any individual's fade pattern.

### 6.3 Limitations

Several limitations constrain the generalizability of our findings:

- **Cohort size**: 14 projects is far below the statistical power needed for reliable model comparison.
- **Cohort selection bias**: Projects were curated based on known founder departures, potentially oversampling dramatic cases.
- **No GitHub API access**: PR and review data were unavailable, limiting the fidelity of involvement share estimates.
- **Binary survival labels**: The TFDD framework's binary classification may not capture the continuum of project health.
- **Single metric**: We focus on commit share; merge and review shares were approximated.

### 6.4 Future Work

To properly test the founder fade curve hypothesis, we propose:

1. **Large-scale validation**: Query GH Archive/BigQuery for per-author per-month commit counts across 5,000+ repositories, enabling statistical power to detect modest effect sizes.
2. **Improved survival labels**: Use the continuous survival ratio (post/pre departure activity) rather than binary labels, and incorporate multi-year follow-up.
3. **Full trajectory data**: Use GitHub API to obtain PR merge and review data, enabling accurate computation of decision-making authority transfer.
4. **Founder-specific tests**: Compare founder fade curves against *matched* non-founder trajectories (same project, same activity level) to control for project-level confounds.
5. **Mechanism tests**: Test whether fade curve shape predicts *time to new truck-factor developer appearance*, not just binary survival.

## 7. Conclusion

We presented the first quantitative evaluation of the founder fade curve hypothesis, which posits that the shape of a founder's involvement trajectory predicts OSS project survival after departure. Our pilot study of 14 projects found that trajectory shape descriptors alone do not predict survival (AUC = 0.408), while static features achieve strong performance (AUC = 0.857). The combined model reaches AUC = 0.898, but shape descriptors contribute minimally to predictive importance. A falsification control found no founder-specific effect.

These results suggest that the scaffolding fade mechanism, while theoretically compelling, requires larger-scale validation before claims of predictive superiority can be supported. The null finding is itself valuable: it indicates that static measures currently capture most of the predictable variance in OSS survival, and that trajectory shape may only emerge as a predictor at larger sample sizes or with more nuanced survival definitions. We call for a full-scale study using GH Archive data to properly test the hypothesis.

title: 'Literature Survey: Founder Fade & OSS Survival'
summary: >-
  This research synthesizes findings across four critical areas for evaluating the Founder Fade Curve hypothesis: (1) OSS
  project abandonment and survival measurement using the Truck Factor Developer Detachment (TFDD) framework from Avelino et
  al. (2019) and Nourry et al. (2024), (2) founder identification methods including Degree of Authorship (DOA) and GitHub
  API alias resolution, (3) large-scale GitHub data sources with GH Archive/BigQuery recommended as primary due to free access
  and comprehensive coverage, and (4) trajectory shape analysis techniques including Theil-Sen estimators, ruptures change-point
  detection, convexity analysis, and composite index construction. Key findings: 57% of OSS projects have truck factor of
  1, 16% experience founder detachment, only 41% survive. The survey identifies significant research gaps for several 2025-2026
  papers cited in the hypothesis, and recommends adopting the Avelino TFDD framework with 1-year inactivity threshold as the
  primary survival definition.

title: GitHub OSS Repos for Founder Fade Study
summary: >-
  This artifact provides a curated dataset of 14,428 public GitHub OSS repositories from the h1alexbel/github-repos collection
  (MIT license, collected via ghminer tool). Each record contains repo-level features: full repo name, branch, description,
  topics, creation date, last commit date, contributor count, PR count, commit count, issue count, fork count, star count,
  disk usage, license, and primary language. A proxy survival label (ACTIVE/INACTIVE) is computed based on contributor count
  and activity ratio, serving as a baseline for the Founder Fade hypothesis that the shape of founder involvement decline
  predicts project survival. The dataset spans multiple ecosystems (JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, etc.) and includes

title: Founder Fade Curve Predicts OSS Survival
summary: >-
  Pilot experiment implementing trajectory shape-descriptor pipeline to predict OSS project survival after founder departure.
  Analyzed 14 curated GitHub repos with documented founder departures (7 survived, 7 collapsed). Key results: (1) Synthetic
  validation passed all 7 assertions, confirming descriptors correctly identify fade/cliff patterns across 30 synthetic trajectories.
  (2) Static features (contributor_count, total_commits, bus_factor) achieved AUC=0.857 via LOOCV logistic regression. (3)
  Trajectory shape descriptors alone achieved AUC=0.408 (below chance). (4) Combined features achieved AUC=0.898 with CoxPH
  concordance=0.92. (5) Falsification control found no founder-specific effect (founder_AUC=non_founder_AUC=0.41). Conclusion:
  fade_index and trajectory shape descriptors do not significantly predict survival beyond static features in this pilot.
  The experiment used git log analysis with fallback for PR merge data, OLS slope computation, and leave-one-out cross-validation
  with permutation tests. Output contains 49 examples including synthetic trajectories, project analyses with predictions,
  and model comparison results.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the paper's contribution is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Review this paper as you would for a top-tier venue submission.

STEP 1 — READ THE PAPER: Read it carefully. Note claims, methodology, and results.

STEP 2 — CHECK THE CODE: Read the supplementary materials to verify the paper's claims.
Do the experiments match what's described? Are there discrepancies between code and paper?

STEP 3 — SEARCH THE LITERATURE: Ground your review in evidence.
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes
- What level of contribution gets accepted at top venues in this area?

STEP 4 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would cause rejection) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: free-first web search (general or scholarly, Serper fallback), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

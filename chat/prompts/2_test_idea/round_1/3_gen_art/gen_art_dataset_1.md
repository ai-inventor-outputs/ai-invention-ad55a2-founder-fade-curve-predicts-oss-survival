title: 'Founder Fade Dataset: OSS Survival Cohort'
summary: >-
  Build a curated cohort of 80-150 GitHub OSS projects where the founder departed, with monthly founder-involvement trajectories
  (commits, merges, reviews), survival labels, and static snapshot features at departure — enabling tests of whether the shape
  of founder involvement decline predicts project survival.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  A single JSON dataset (data_out.json) containing 80-150 public GitHub OSS project records. Each record must include: (1)
  project metadata (full_name, founder_github_login, founder_email_aliases, departure_date, founder_first_commit_date, primary_language,
  umbrella_org_or_standalone); (2) three monthly time-series arrays from inception through departure date — founder_share_commits
  (float 0-1 per month), founder_share_merges (float 0-1 per month), founder_share_reviews (float 0-1 per month), each with
  raw counts (founder_count, total_count) so downstream can recompute at alternative granularities; (3) a binary survival
  label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE) with a confidence annotation (high/medium/low) and the reasoning basis; (4) a continuous retention_ratio
  (post-departure monthly commit volume / pre-departure baseline, averaged over 24 months post and 24 months pre); (5) static
  snapshot features at departure date: total_contributor_count, project_age_months, star_count, fork_count, file_count, bus_factor
  (DOA-based using 90-day active contributors), language; (6) a metadata_fold field for 5-fold stratified cross-validation
  splits. The cohort should be roughly balanced between SURVIVE and COLLAPSE (target 40-60% each), span multiple ecosystems
  (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby), and include projects with >= 24 months of history before founder departure. Raw per-month
  per-author event counts should be included so the experiment can recompute at alternative time-window granularities.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  PHASE 1 — Cohort Discovery (Target: 200+ candidates, filter to 80-150 final)

  Step 1.1: Identify candidate repositories with departed founders
  - Use GitHub Search API (authenticated with GITHUB_TOKEN) to find public repos with:
    - >= 100 stars (ensures sufficient activity history)
    - >= 24 months old (ensures enough pre-departure trajectory)
    - Primary languages: Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby
    - Query patterns: `stars:>=100 created:<=2022-01-01 language:Python`, repeat for each language
  - For COLLAPSE candidates: also search for archived repos (`is:archived stars:>=100`), repos with DEPRECATED in README, and repos with no commits in last 12 months
  - For SURVIVE candidates: search for repos with active commits but whose creator/first committer is inactive
  - Paginate through results, collecting repo full_names into a candidate list
  - Target: 300-500 candidate repos to allow filtering down to 80-150 quality projects

  Step 1.2: Identify founder for each candidate
  - For each candidate repo, call GitHub API `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` to get `owner.login` (repository creator)
  - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?per_page=1&sort=commit:committer-date&direction=asc` to get earliest committer
  - Cross-validate: founder = repo creator if they match earliest committer; if not, use earliest sustained committer (the one with >= 5 commits in first 3 months)
  - Record founder_github_login and founder_email_aliases (from git log parsing later)

  Step 1.3: Verify founder departure
  - For each candidate, check founder's last activity in the repo:
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?author={founder_login}&per_page=1&sort=commit:committer-date&direction=desc` to get founder's last commit date
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100` and check if founder merged any PRs after last commit
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?creator={founder_login}&state=all&per_page=100` for issue activity
  - Compute inactivity window: days since founder's last activity in this repo
  - Require >= 12 months (365 days) of contiguous inactivity to classify as 'departed'
  - If founder is still active (inactivity < 12 months), exclude from cohort
  - Record departure_date as the date of founder's last activity

  Step 1.4: Balance survive/collapse ratio
  - For each departed-founder repo, do a preliminary survival check:
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?since={departure_date_plus_12_months}&per_page=1` to check if ANY commits exist 12+ months post-departure
    - If zero commits in 12+ months post-departure: likely COLLAPSE
    - If commits exist: likely SURVIVE (verify further in Phase 2)
  - Oversample COLLAPSE candidates (they are rarer and more informative)
  - Aim for roughly 50/50 split in final cohort

  PHASE 2 — Data Extraction (for each of 80-150 selected projects)

  Step 2.1: Clone repository and parse git history
  - Clone via HTTPS: `git clone --bare https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}.git /tmp/{repo_slug}/`
  - Use GitPython to parse commit history:
    - Run: `git log --format='%H|%ae|%an|%aI' --since={first_commit} --until={departure_date_plus_24_months}`
    - Group commits by month and author
    - Compute founder_share_commits per month = founder_commits / total_commits
    - Store raw per-month per-author counts in the record
  - Handle edge cases: repos with no commits in certain months (fill with 0), repos with very sparse history (flag)

  Step 2.2: Extract PR merge data via GitHub API
  - For each repo, paginate through `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100` from repo creation to departure_date + 24 months
  - For each PR, record: merged_by (the merger), merged_at date
  - Group by month and compute founder_share_merges = founder_merges / total_merges
  - If repo has no PRs (direct commits only), set merge channel to null and note in metadata
  - Rate limit handling: implement exponential backoff (start at 1s, double on 403, max 60s); track remaining requests from API headers

  Step 2.3: Extract code review data via GitHub API
  - For each repo, paginate through `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100`
  - For each PR, call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` to get all reviews
  - Record reviewer and review date
  - Group by month and compute founder_share_reviews = founder_reviews / total_reviews
  - If a repo has too many PRs for review endpoint (rate limit risk), sample: take every Nth PR where N scales with total PR count to stay within rate limits
  - Fallback: if review data unavailable for a repo, set review channel to null and note in metadata

  Step 2.4: Compute survival labels
  - Binary label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE):
    - SURVIVE if: (a) >= 5 commits/month median over 24 months post-departure AND at least 18 of 24 months have >= 2 commits, OR (b) at least one new contributor (not in pre-departure top-5) accumulates >= 20% of post-departure commit share (adapted from Avelino et al. truck-factor criterion)
    - COLLAPSE if: activity falls below threshold (median < 5 commits/month AND < 18 months with >= 2 commits)
    - Confidence annotation: 'high' if clear threshold crossing, 'medium' if near threshold, 'low' if ambiguous (e.g., sporadic commits)
  - Continuous retention_ratio:
    - Pre-departure baseline: average monthly commits over 24 months before departure (or full pre-departure period if < 24 months)
    - Post-departure volume: average monthly commits over 24 months after departure (or available period)
    - Ratio = post / pre (capped at 1.0 if post > pre, floor at 0.0)

  Step 2.5: Compute static snapshot features at departure date
  - total_contributor_count: unique authors with commits before departure
  - project_age_months: months from first commit to departure date
  - star_count, fork_count: from repo API at departure date (use current values if historical unavailable, note in metadata)
  - file_count: number of files at departure (from git tree at departure commit)
  - primary_language: from repo API
  - bus_factor: compute using Cosentino et al. DOA-based formula:
    - Identify 90-day active contributors before departure
    - Compute DOA (Degree of Authorship) for each: commits_by_author / total_commits
    - Bus factor = minimum number of developers whose removal would cause > 50% loss of DOA
    - Sort contributors by DOA descending, accumulate until > 50%, count = bus factor
  - umbrella_org_or_standalone: 'org' if repo owner is an organization, 'standalone' if individual

  PHASE 3 — Validation and Quality Control

  Step 3.1: Spot-check 10% of labels
  - For a random 10% sample, verify:
    - Founder identification: check repo README, CONTRIBUTING.md, or GitHub contributors page
    - Survival label: check if repo is archived, has DEPRECATED in README, or has a clear successor maintainer
    - Departure date: verify founder has no activity after recorded departure
  - Flag any discrepancies for manual review

  Step 3.2: Cross-validate founder identification
  - For each project, confirm founder is the repo creator AND earliest sustained committer
  - If mismatch, use the earliest sustained committer and note the discrepancy
  - Exclude projects where founder cannot be reliably identified

  Step 3.3: Handle missing data
  - If merge or review channels are unavailable for a project, include null values and a flag
  - If git history is incomplete (shallow clone, missing history), exclude the project
  - If post-departure window is < 12 months (repo too recent), exclude

  PHASE 4 — Dataset Assembly and Output

  Step 4.1: Build JSON schema and validate
  - Define JSON schema with all required fields (see ideal_dataset_criteria)
  - Use aii-json skill to validate all records against schema
  - Ensure all time-series arrays have consistent monthly granularity
  - Ensure all numeric fields are properly typed (float for ratios, int for counts)

  Step 4.2: Create 5-fold stratified cross-validation splits
  - Stratify by survival label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE)
  - Assign each project to one of 5 folds (metadata_fold: 0-4)
  - Ensure each fold has roughly equal numbers of SURVIVE and COLLAPSE projects

  Step 4.3: Generate full, mini, and preview variants
  - Full: all 80-150 projects
  - Mini: 10-20 representative projects (stratified by label, language, and fade curve shape)
  - Preview: 3-5 projects (1 SURVIVE with clear fade, 1 COLLAPSE with cliff, 1 ambiguous)

  Step 4.4: Write data dictionary (DATA_DICTIONARY.md)
  - Document every operational definition (founder, departure, survival, bus factor, retention ratio)
  - Document all filtering criteria used to select the cohort
  - Document rate-limit handling approach
  - Document any ambiguous-label flags and their resolution
  - Document data sources (GitHub API endpoints, git log parsing)
  - Document known limitations and edge cases

  ERROR HANDLING AND FAILURE SCENARIOS:

  1. Rate limit exhaustion: Implement token bucket rate limiting with exponential backoff. If rate limits are hit repeatedly, pause for 1 hour and resume. Track cumulative API usage and switch to git-log-only mode (commits channel only) if API budget is exhausted.

  2. Too few COLLAPSE candidates: If natural sampling yields < 30% collapse, actively search for archived repos, deprecated projects, and repos with no commits in 18+ months. Consider lowering star threshold to 50 for collapse candidates.

  3. Too few SURVIVE candidates: If natural sampling yields < 30% survive, search for long-lived projects (5+ years) where the creator is no longer active but the project continues.

  4. Incomplete git history: Some repos may have truncated history. Check `git log --oneline | wc -l` and exclude repos with < 100 total commits (insufficient trajectory).

  5. Founder ambiguity: If the repo creator is not the earliest sustained committer, use the earliest sustained committer as founder. If multiple early contributors have similar activity, flag as ambiguous and exclude if ambiguity cannot be resolved.

  6. Large repos with millions of commits: Use `git log --since` and `--until` flags to limit the time window. For very large repos, consider sampling commits (e.g., every 10th commit) for the pre-departure window, noting the sampling rate in metadata.

  7. API changes or downtime: If GitHub API is unavailable, fall back to git-log-only mode (commits channel only) and note the limitation. The merge and review channels are secondary to the commit channel for the primary hypothesis test.

  TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION (6 hours total):
  - Phase 1 (Discovery): 1.5 hours
  - Phase 2 (Extraction): 3 hours (most time-intensive)
  - Phase 3 (Validation): 0.5 hours
  - Phase 4 (Assembly): 1 hour

  PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY:
  - Phase 1: Parallel API calls for candidate discovery (batch of 10-20 repos per iteration)
  - Phase 2: Parallel git cloning and log parsing (use multiprocessing, 4-8 workers)
  - Phase 2: Sequential API calls for PR merges/reviews (rate-limited, but parallelize across repos with token bucket)
  - Use asyncio for I/O-bound API calls and multiprocessing for CPU-bound git parsing

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

</available_domain_handbooks>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 8 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 4 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 2 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.

### [3] SKILL-INPUT — aii-python · 2026-08-20 20:40:00 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-python** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-python
description: Python coding standards for experiment and evaluation scripts. Covers environment setup, logging, error handling, and code structure.
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: Gradual scaling pattern for long-running autonomous tasks. Use when running experiments, evaluations, or any code that processes data at increasing scale with runtime checks.
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

name: aii-json
description: JSON validation and formatting toolkit. Validate JSON files against schemas for experiment pipelines, and generate full/mini/preview versions of JSON datasets. Use for validating pipeline outputs, checking schema compliance, or creating size-optimized JSON variants.

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**
- `sel_hypo_out.json` - Hypothesis Selection output (all hypotheses with selected flags)
- `feasibility_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with feasibility scores
- `feasibility_eval_top.json` - Top 5 most feasible hypotheses
- `novelty_research_one.json` - Single hypothesis novelty research arguments with citations
- `novelty_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with novelty scores
- `novelty_eval_top.json` - Single best selected hypothesis

**Experiment Pipeline:**
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

---

## File Size Check

After generating output files, run `ls -lh` to check sizes. If ANY file exceeds the provided file size limit:

1. Create directory with same base name (e.g., `data_out/` for `full_data_out.json`)
2. Split into parts under the limit named: `full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out_2.json`, etc.
3. Place parts in directory (e.g., `data_out/full_data_out_1.json`, `data_out/full_data_out_2.json`)
4. Delete the original oversized file
5. Update the script to read from split files: `for f in sorted(glob.glob('data_out/full_data_out_*.json')): data.extend(json.load(open(f)))`
6. For each split part, generate its own mini/preview versions with the json skill's format script

name: aii-use-hardware
description: Detect hardware and use it responsibly. Covers CPU/RAM/GPU detection, memory-safe data processing, and resource-aware computation.
---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

### [8] SKILL-INPUT — aii-parallel-computing · 2026-08-20 20:40:02 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-parallel-computing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-parallel-computing
description: "CRITICAL PERFORMANCE SKILL. Maximize hardware utilization for compute-intensive tasks. Covers GPU acceleration, CPU parallelism, and async I/O. The difference between hours of failure and minutes of success. Use whenever writing ANY script that processes data, makes API calls, or does computation."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5

$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 dataset(s) for query='text classification'

============================================================
Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

---

### Preview HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_preview_datasets.py)

Inspect a specific dataset - shows metadata AND sample rows.

**Example input:**
```bash

$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --num-rows 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --num-rows 3' ::: 'openai/gsm8k' 'imdb' 'squad'

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel. Use `eval {}` pattern when datasets need different flags (e.g. `--config`):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: '$PY $S openai/gsm8k --config main --split train' '$PY $S imdb --split train' '$PY $S squad --split train'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded: openai/gsm8k

  train:
    Rows: 7,473
    Preview: temp/datasets/preview_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Mini: temp/datasets/mini_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Full: temp/datasets/full_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Use preview to see available configs

`--split` (optional)
- Specific split to load (e.g., `train`, `test`)
- If not specified, loads all splits

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

### [10] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-08-20 20:40:42 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: free-first web search (general or scholarly, Serper fallback), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

title: 'Founder Fade Dataset: OSS Survival Cohort'
summary: >-
  Build a curated cohort of 80-150 GitHub OSS projects where the founder departed, with monthly founder-involvement trajectories
  (commits, merges, reviews), survival labels, and static snapshot features at departure — enabling tests of whether the shape
  of founder involvement decline predicts project survival.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  A single JSON dataset (data_out.json) containing 80-150 public GitHub OSS project records. Each record must include: (1)
  project metadata (full_name, founder_github_login, founder_email_aliases, departure_date, founder_first_commit_date, primary_language,
  umbrella_org_or_standalone); (2) three monthly time-series arrays from inception through departure date — founder_share_commits
  (float 0-1 per month), founder_share_merges (float 0-1 per month), founder_share_reviews (float 0-1 per month), each with
  raw counts (founder_count, total_count) so downstream can recompute at alternative granularities; (3) a binary survival
  label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE) with a confidence annotation (high/medium/low) and the reasoning basis; (4) a continuous retention_ratio
  (post-departure monthly commit volume / pre-departure baseline, averaged over 24 months post and 24 months pre); (5) static
  snapshot features at departure date: total_contributor_count, project_age_months, star_count, fork_count, file_count, bus_factor
  (DOA-based using 90-day active contributors), language; (6) a metadata_fold field for 5-fold stratified cross-validation
  splits. The cohort should be roughly balanced between SURVIVE and COLLAPSE (target 40-60% each), span multiple ecosystems
  (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby), and include projects with >= 24 months of history before founder departure. Raw per-month
  per-author event counts should be included so the experiment can recompute at alternative time-window granularities.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  PHASE 1 — Cohort Discovery (Target: 200+ candidates, filter to 80-150 final)

  Step 1.1: Identify candidate repositories with departed founders
  - Use GitHub Search API (authenticated with GITHUB_TOKEN) to find public repos with:
    - >= 100 stars (ensures sufficient activity history)
    - >= 24 months old (ensures enough pre-departure trajectory)
    - Primary languages: Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby
    - Query patterns: `stars:>=100 created:<=2022-01-01 language:Python`, repeat for each language
  - For COLLAPSE candidates: also search for archived repos (`is:archived stars:>=100`), repos with DEPRECATED in README, and repos with no commits in last 12 months
  - For SURVIVE candidates: search for repos with active commits but whose creator/first committer is inactive
  - Paginate through results, collecting repo full_names into a candidate list
  - Target: 300-500 candidate repos to allow filtering down to 80-150 quality projects

  Step 1.2: Identify founder for each candidate
  - For each candidate repo, call GitHub API `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` to get `owner.login` (repository creator)
  - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?per_page=1&sort=commit:committer-date&direction=asc` to get earliest committer
  - Cross-validate: founder = repo creator if they match earliest committer; if not, use earliest sustained committer (the one with >= 5 commits in first 3 months)
  - Record founder_github_login and founder_email_aliases (from git log parsing later)

  Step 1.3: Verify founder departure
  - For each candidate, check founder's last activity in the repo:
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?author={founder_login}&per_page=1&sort=commit:committer-date&direction=desc` to get founder's last commit date
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100` and check if founder merged any PRs after last commit
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?creator={founder_login}&state=all&per_page=100` for issue activity
  - Compute inactivity window: days since founder's last activity in this repo
  - Require >= 12 months (365 days) of contiguous inactivity to classify as 'departed'
  - If founder is still active (inactivity < 12 months), exclude from cohort
  - Record departure_date as the date of founder's last activity

  Step 1.4: Balance survive/collapse ratio
  - For each departed-founder repo, do a preliminary survival check:
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?since={departure_date_plus_12_months}&per_page=1` to check if ANY commits exist 12+ months post-departure
    - If zero commits in 12+ months post-departure: likely COLLAPSE
    - If commits exist: likely SURVIVE (verify further in Phase 2)
  - Oversample COLLAPSE candidates (they are rarer and more informative)
  - Aim for roughly 50/50 split in final cohort

  PHASE 2 — Data Extraction (for each of 80-150 selected projects)

  Step 2.1: Clone repository and parse git history
  - Clone via HTTPS: `git clone --bare https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}.git /tmp/{repo_slug}/`
  - Use GitPython to parse commit history:
    - Run: `git log --format='%H|%ae|%an|%aI' --since={first_commit} --until={departure_date_plus_24_months}`
    - Group commits by month and author
    - Compute founder_share_commits per month = founder_commits / total_commits
    - Store raw per-month per-author counts in the record
  - Handle edge cases: repos with no commits in certain months (fill with 0), repos with very sparse history (flag)

  Step 2.2: Extract PR merge data via GitHub API
  - For each repo, paginate through `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100` from repo creation to departure_date + 24 months
  - For each PR, record: merged_by (the merger), merged_at date
  - Group by month and compute founder_share_merges = founder_merges / total_merges
  - If repo has no PRs (direct commits only), set merge channel to null and note in metadata
  - Rate limit handling: implement exponential backoff (start at 1s, double on 403, max 60s); track remaining requests from API headers

  Step 2.3: Extract code review data via GitHub API
  - For each repo, paginate through `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100`
  - For each PR, call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` to get all reviews
  - Record reviewer and review date
  - Group by month and compute founder_share_reviews = founder_reviews / total_reviews
  - If a repo has too many PRs for review endpoint (rate limit risk), sample: take every Nth PR where N scales with total PR count to stay within rate limits
  - Fallback: if review data unavailable for a repo, set review channel to null and note in metadata

  Step 2.4: Compute survival labels
  - Binary label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE):
    - SURVIVE if: (a) >= 5 commits/month median over 24 months post-departure AND at least 18 of 24 months have >= 2 commits, OR (b) at least one new contributor (not in pre-departure top-5) accumulates >= 20% of post-departure commit share (adapted from Avelino et al. truck-factor criterion)
    - COLLAPSE if: activity falls below threshold (median < 5 commits/month AND < 18 months with >= 2 commits)
    - Confidence annotation: 'high' if clear threshold crossing, 'medium' if near threshold, 'low' if ambiguous (e.g., sporadic commits)
  - Continuous retention_ratio:
    - Pre-departure baseline: average monthly commits over 24 months before departure (or full pre-departure period if < 24 months)
    - Post-departure volume: average monthly commits over 24 months after departure (or available period)
    - Ratio = post / pre (capped at 1.0 if post > pre, floor at 0.0)

  Step 2.5: Compute static snapshot features at departure date
  - total_contributor_count: unique authors with commits before departure
  - project_age_months: months from first commit to departure date
  - star_count, fork_count: from repo API at departure date (use current values if historical unavailable, note in metadata)
  - file_count: number of files at departure (from git tree at departure commit)
  - primary_language: from repo API
  - bus_factor: compute using Cosentino et al. DOA-based formula:
    - Identify 90-day active contributors before departure
    - Compute DOA (Degree of Authorship) for each: commits_by_author / total_commits
    - Bus factor = minimum number of developers whose removal would cause > 50% loss of DOA
    - Sort contributors by DOA descending, accumulate until > 50%, count = bus factor
  - umbrella_org_or_standalone: 'org' if repo owner is an organization, 'standalone' if individual

  PHASE 3 — Validation and Quality Control

  Step 3.1: Spot-check 10% of labels
  - For a random 10% sample, verify:
    - Founder identification: check repo README, CONTRIBUTING.md, or GitHub contributors page
    - Survival label: check if repo is archived, has DEPRECATED in README, or has a clear successor maintainer
    - Departure date: verify founder has no activity after recorded departure
  - Flag any discrepancies for manual review

  Step 3.2: Cross-validate founder identification
  - For each project, confirm founder is the repo creator AND earliest sustained committer
  - If mismatch, use the earliest sustained committer and note the discrepancy
  - Exclude projects where founder cannot be reliably identified

  Step 3.3: Handle missing data
  - If merge or review channels are unavailable for a project, include null values and a flag
  - If git history is incomplete (shallow clone, missing history), exclude the project
  - If post-departure window is < 12 months (repo too recent), exclude

  PHASE 4 — Dataset Assembly and Output

  Step 4.1: Build JSON schema and validate
  - Define JSON schema with all required fields (see ideal_dataset_criteria)
  - Use aii-json skill to validate all records against schema
  - Ensure all time-series arrays have consistent monthly granularity
  - Ensure all numeric fields are properly typed (float for ratios, int for counts)

  Step 4.2: Create 5-fold stratified cross-validation splits
  - Stratify by survival label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE)
  - Assign each project to one of 5 folds (metadata_fold: 0-4)
  - Ensure each fold has roughly equal numbers of SURVIVE and COLLAPSE projects

  Step 4.3: Generate full, mini, and preview variants
  - Full: all 80-150 projects
  - Mini: 10-20 representative projects (stratified by label, language, and fade curve shape)
  - Preview: 3-5 projects (1 SURVIVE with clear fade, 1 COLLAPSE with cliff, 1 ambiguous)

  Step 4.4: Write data dictionary (DATA_DICTIONARY.md)
  - Document every operational definition (founder, departure, survival, bus factor, retention ratio)
  - Document all filtering criteria used to select the cohort
  - Document rate-limit handling approach
  - Document any ambiguous-label flags and their resolution
  - Document data sources (GitHub API endpoints, git log parsing)
  - Document known limitations and edge cases

  ERROR HANDLING AND FAILURE SCENARIOS:

  1. Rate limit exhaustion: Implement token bucket rate limiting with exponential backoff. If rate limits are hit repeatedly, pause for 1 hour and resume. Track cumulative API usage and switch to git-log-only mode (commits channel only) if API budget is exhausted.

  2. Too few COLLAPSE candidates: If natural sampling yields < 30% collapse, actively search for archived repos, deprecated projects, and repos with no commits in 18+ months. Consider lowering star threshold to 50 for collapse candidates.

  3. Too few SURVIVE candidates: If natural sampling yields < 30% survive, search for long-lived projects (5+ years) where the creator is no longer active but the project continues.

  4. Incomplete git history: Some repos may have truncated history. Check `git log --oneline | wc -l` and exclude repos with < 100 total commits (insufficient trajectory).

  5. Founder ambiguity: If the repo creator is not the earliest sustained committer, use the earliest sustained committer as founder. If multiple early contributors have similar activity, flag as ambiguous and exclude if ambiguity cannot be resolved.

  6. Large repos with millions of commits: Use `git log --since` and `--until` flags to limit the time window. For very large repos, consider sampling commits (e.g., every 10th commit) for the pre-departure window, noting the sampling rate in metadata.

  7. API changes or downtime: If GitHub API is unavailable, fall back to git-log-only mode (commits channel only) and note the limitation. The merge and review channels are secondary to the commit channel for the primary hypothesis test.

  TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION (6 hours total):
  - Phase 1 (Discovery): 1.5 hours
  - Phase 2 (Extraction): 3 hours (most time-intensive)
  - Phase 3 (Validation): 0.5 hours
  - Phase 4 (Assembly): 1 hour

  PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY:
  - Phase 1: Parallel API calls for candidate discovery (batch of 10-20 repos per iteration)
  - Phase 2: Parallel git cloning and log parsing (use multiprocessing, 4-8 workers)
  - Phase 2: Sequential API calls for PR merges/reviews (rate-limited, but parallelize across repos with token bucket)
  - Use asyncio for I/O-bound API calls and multiprocessing for CPU-bound git parsing

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

</available_domain_handbooks>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.
</repo_upload_exclusions>

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. For the top 2 datasets, create data.py (uv inline script) that: loads from temp/datasets/, standardizes to exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill), extracts all examples per dataset, handles domain requirements, saves to full_data_out.json.

Each data ROW must be a separate example — do NOT create one example per dataset or per fold. Each data point (row, sample, instance) = one example. 500 rows → 500 examples. The output is GROUPED BY DATASET:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    {
      "dataset": "iris",
      "examples": [
        {"input": "...", "output": "...", "metadata_fold": 2, "metadata_feature_names": [...]},
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "dataset": "adult_census",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```
Per-example required fields:
- `input`: input features/text (tabular: JSON string of feature values)
- `output`: target/label (as string)
Per-example optional metadata via `metadata_<name>` fields (flat, not nested object):
- `metadata_fold`: fold assignment (int), `metadata_feature_names`: feature name list, `metadata_task_type`: "classification"/"regression", `metadata_n_classes`: number of classes, `metadata_row_index`: original row index, etc.
Do NOT use `split`, `dataset`, or `context` as per-example fields. Dataset name goes at the group level, metadata goes in `metadata_*` fields.
TODO 2. Run 'uv run data.py' and fix errors. Validate full_data_out.json against exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill) — fix errors. Generate preview, mini, full versions with aii-json skill's format script.
TODO 3. Read preview to inspect examples. Choose THE BEST 1 DATASET based on domain requirements and artifact objective. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

title: 'Founder Fade Dataset: OSS Survival Cohort'
summary: >-
  Build a curated cohort of 80-150 GitHub OSS projects where the founder departed, with monthly founder-involvement trajectories
  (commits, merges, reviews), survival labels, and static snapshot features at departure — enabling tests of whether the shape
  of founder involvement decline predicts project survival.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  A single JSON dataset (data_out.json) containing 80-150 public GitHub OSS project records. Each record must include: (1)
  project metadata (full_name, founder_github_login, founder_email_aliases, departure_date, founder_first_commit_date, primary_language,
  umbrella_org_or_standalone); (2) three monthly time-series arrays from inception through departure date — founder_share_commits
  (float 0-1 per month), founder_share_merges (float 0-1 per month), founder_share_reviews (float 0-1 per month), each with
  raw counts (founder_count, total_count) so downstream can recompute at alternative granularities; (3) a binary survival
  label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE) with a confidence annotation (high/medium/low) and the reasoning basis; (4) a continuous retention_ratio
  (post-departure monthly commit volume / pre-departure baseline, averaged over 24 months post and 24 months pre); (5) static
  snapshot features at departure date: total_contributor_count, project_age_months, star_count, fork_count, file_count, bus_factor
  (DOA-based using 90-day active contributors), language; (6) a metadata_fold field for 5-fold stratified cross-validation
  splits. The cohort should be roughly balanced between SURVIVE and COLLAPSE (target 40-60% each), span multiple ecosystems
  (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby), and include projects with >= 24 months of history before founder departure. Raw per-month
  per-author event counts should be included so the experiment can recompute at alternative time-window granularities.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  PHASE 1 — Cohort Discovery (Target: 200+ candidates, filter to 80-150 final)

  Step 1.1: Identify candidate repositories with departed founders
  - Use GitHub Search API (authenticated with GITHUB_TOKEN) to find public repos with:
    - >= 100 stars (ensures sufficient activity history)
    - >= 24 months old (ensures enough pre-departure trajectory)
    - Primary languages: Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby
    - Query patterns: `stars:>=100 created:<=2022-01-01 language:Python`, repeat for each language
  - For COLLAPSE candidates: also search for archived repos (`is:archived stars:>=100`), repos with DEPRECATED in README, and repos with no commits in last 12 months
  - For SURVIVE candidates: search for repos with active commits but whose creator/first committer is inactive
  - Paginate through results, collecting repo full_names into a candidate list
  - Target: 300-500 candidate repos to allow filtering down to 80-150 quality projects

  Step 1.2: Identify founder for each candidate
  - For each candidate repo, call GitHub API `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` to get `owner.login` (repository creator)
  - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?per_page=1&sort=commit:committer-date&direction=asc` to get earliest committer
  - Cross-validate: founder = repo creator if they match earliest committer; if not, use earliest sustained committer (the one with >= 5 commits in first 3 months)
  - Record founder_github_login and founder_email_aliases (from git log parsing later)

  Step 1.3: Verify founder departure
  - For each candidate, check founder's last activity in the repo:
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?author={founder_login}&per_page=1&sort=commit:committer-date&direction=desc` to get founder's last commit date
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100` and check if founder merged any PRs after last commit
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?creator={founder_login}&state=all&per_page=100` for issue activity
  - Compute inactivity window: days since founder's last activity in this repo
  - Require >= 12 months (365 days) of contiguous inactivity to classify as 'departed'
  - If founder is still active (inactivity < 12 months), exclude from cohort
  - Record departure_date as the date of founder's last activity

  Step 1.4: Balance survive/collapse ratio
  - For each departed-founder repo, do a preliminary survival check:
    - Call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?since={departure_date_plus_12_months}&per_page=1` to check if ANY commits exist 12+ months post-departure
    - If zero commits in 12+ months post-departure: likely COLLAPSE
    - If commits exist: likely SURVIVE (verify further in Phase 2)
  - Oversample COLLAPSE candidates (they are rarer and more informative)
  - Aim for roughly 50/50 split in final cohort

  PHASE 2 — Data Extraction (for each of 80-150 selected projects)

  Step 2.1: Clone repository and parse git history
  - Clone via HTTPS: `git clone --bare https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}.git /tmp/{repo_slug}/`
  - Use GitPython to parse commit history:
    - Run: `git log --format='%H|%ae|%an|%aI' --since={first_commit} --until={departure_date_plus_24_months}`
    - Group commits by month and author
    - Compute founder_share_commits per month = founder_commits / total_commits
    - Store raw per-month per-author counts in the record
  - Handle edge cases: repos with no commits in certain months (fill with 0), repos with very sparse history (flag)

  Step 2.2: Extract PR merge data via GitHub API
  - For each repo, paginate through `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100` from repo creation to departure_date + 24 months
  - For each PR, record: merged_by (the merger), merged_at date
  - Group by month and compute founder_share_merges = founder_merges / total_merges
  - If repo has no PRs (direct commits only), set merge channel to null and note in metadata
  - Rate limit handling: implement exponential backoff (start at 1s, double on 403, max 60s); track remaining requests from API headers

  Step 2.3: Extract code review data via GitHub API
  - For each repo, paginate through `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=closed&per_page=100`
  - For each PR, call `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews` to get all reviews
  - Record reviewer and review date
  - Group by month and compute founder_share_reviews = founder_reviews / total_reviews
  - If a repo has too many PRs for review endpoint (rate limit risk), sample: take every Nth PR where N scales with total PR count to stay within rate limits
  - Fallback: if review data unavailable for a repo, set review channel to null and note in metadata

  Step 2.4: Compute survival labels
  - Binary label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE):
    - SURVIVE if: (a) >= 5 commits/month median over 24 months post-departure AND at least 18 of 24 months have >= 2 commits, OR (b) at least one new contributor (not in pre-departure top-5) accumulates >= 20% of post-departure commit share (adapted from Avelino et al. truck-factor criterion)
    - COLLAPSE if: activity falls below threshold (median < 5 commits/month AND < 18 months with >= 2 commits)
    - Confidence annotation: 'high' if clear threshold crossing, 'medium' if near threshold, 'low' if ambiguous (e.g., sporadic commits)
  - Continuous retention_ratio:
    - Pre-departure baseline: average monthly commits over 24 months before departure (or full pre-departure period if < 24 months)
    - Post-departure volume: average monthly commits over 24 months after departure (or available period)
    - Ratio = post / pre (capped at 1.0 if post > pre, floor at 0.0)

  Step 2.5: Compute static snapshot features at departure date
  - total_contributor_count: unique authors with commits before departure
  - project_age_months: months from first commit to departure date
  - star_count, fork_count: from repo API at departure date (use current values if historical unavailable, note in metadata)
  - file_count: number of files at departure (from git tree at departure commit)
  - primary_language: from repo API
  - bus_factor: compute using Cosentino et al. DOA-based formula:
    - Identify 90-day active contributors before departure
    - Compute DOA (Degree of Authorship) for each: commits_by_author / total_commits
    - Bus factor = minimum number of developers whose removal would cause > 50% loss of DOA
    - Sort contributors by DOA descending, accumulate until > 50%, count = bus factor
  - umbrella_org_or_standalone: 'org' if repo owner is an organization, 'standalone' if individual

  PHASE 3 — Validation and Quality Control

  Step 3.1: Spot-check 10% of labels
  - For a random 10% sample, verify:
    - Founder identification: check repo README, CONTRIBUTING.md, or GitHub contributors page
    - Survival label: check if repo is archived, has DEPRECATED in README, or has a clear successor maintainer
    - Departure date: verify founder has no activity after recorded departure
  - Flag any discrepancies for manual review

  Step 3.2: Cross-validate founder identification
  - For each project, confirm founder is the repo creator AND earliest sustained committer
  - If mismatch, use the earliest sustained committer and note the discrepancy
  - Exclude projects where founder cannot be reliably identified

  Step 3.3: Handle missing data
  - If merge or review channels are unavailable for a project, include null values and a flag
  - If git history is incomplete (shallow clone, missing history), exclude the project
  - If post-departure window is < 12 months (repo too recent), exclude

  PHASE 4 — Dataset Assembly and Output

  Step 4.1: Build JSON schema and validate
  - Define JSON schema with all required fields (see ideal_dataset_criteria)
  - Use aii-json skill to validate all records against schema
  - Ensure all time-series arrays have consistent monthly granularity
  - Ensure all numeric fields are properly typed (float for ratios, int for counts)

  Step 4.2: Create 5-fold stratified cross-validation splits
  - Stratify by survival label (SURVIVE/COLLAPSE)
  - Assign each project to one of 5 folds (metadata_fold: 0-4)
  - Ensure each fold has roughly equal numbers of SURVIVE and COLLAPSE projects

  Step 4.3: Generate full, mini, and preview variants
  - Full: all 80-150 projects
  - Mini: 10-20 representative projects (stratified by label, language, and fade curve shape)
  - Preview: 3-5 projects (1 SURVIVE with clear fade, 1 COLLAPSE with cliff, 1 ambiguous)

  Step 4.4: Write data dictionary (DATA_DICTIONARY.md)
  - Document every operational definition (founder, departure, survival, bus factor, retention ratio)
  - Document all filtering criteria used to select the cohort
  - Document rate-limit handling approach
  - Document any ambiguous-label flags and their resolution
  - Document data sources (GitHub API endpoints, git log parsing)
  - Document known limitations and edge cases

  ERROR HANDLING AND FAILURE SCENARIOS:

  1. Rate limit exhaustion: Implement token bucket rate limiting with exponential backoff. If rate limits are hit repeatedly, pause for 1 hour and resume. Track cumulative API usage and switch to git-log-only mode (commits channel only) if API budget is exhausted.

  2. Too few COLLAPSE candidates: If natural sampling yields < 30% collapse, actively search for archived repos, deprecated projects, and repos with no commits in 18+ months. Consider lowering star threshold to 50 for collapse candidates.

  3. Too few SURVIVE candidates: If natural sampling yields < 30% survive, search for long-lived projects (5+ years) where the creator is no longer active but the project continues.

  4. Incomplete git history: Some repos may have truncated history. Check `git log --oneline | wc -l` and exclude repos with < 100 total commits (insufficient trajectory).

  5. Founder ambiguity: If the repo creator is not the earliest sustained committer, use the earliest sustained committer as founder. If multiple early contributors have similar activity, flag as ambiguous and exclude if ambiguity cannot be resolved.

  6. Large repos with millions of commits: Use `git log --since` and `--until` flags to limit the time window. For very large repos, consider sampling commits (e.g., every 10th commit) for the pre-departure window, noting the sampling rate in metadata.

  7. API changes or downtime: If GitHub API is unavailable, fall back to git-log-only mode (commits channel only) and note the limitation. The merge and review channels are secondary to the commit channel for the primary hypothesis test.

  TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION (6 hours total):
  - Phase 1 (Discovery): 1.5 hours
  - Phase 2 (Extraction): 3 hours (most time-intensive)
  - Phase 3 (Validation): 0.5 hours
  - Phase 4 (Assembly): 1 hour

  PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY:
  - Phase 1: Parallel API calls for candidate discovery (batch of 10-20 repos per iteration)
  - Phase 2: Parallel git cloning and log parsing (use multiprocessing, 4-8 workers)
  - Phase 2: Sequential API calls for PR merges/reviews (rate-limited, but parallelize across repos with token bucket)
  - Use asyncio for I/O-bound API calls and multiprocessing for CPU-bound git parsing

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Update data.py to only include the chosen 1 dataset and generate full_data_out.json. Re-run to generate full_data_out.json. Validate output format with aii-json skill and fix any errors. Generate full, mini, and preview versions with aii-json skill's format script using `--input full_data_out.json` (creates full_full_data_out.json, mini_full_data_out.json, preview_full_data_out.json — rename to full_data_out.json, mini_data_out.json, preview_data_out.json).
TODO 2. Verify full_data_out.json, preview_data_out.json, and mini_data_out.json exist in your workspace (see <workspace>) and contain correct data.
TODO 3. Apply aii-file-size-limit skill's file size check procedure (100MB limit) to full_data_out.json.
TODO 4. Ensure a `pyproject.toml` exists in your workspace with ALL dependencies pinned to the exact versions installed in your .venv (run `.venv/bin/pip freeze` to get them). This is required for reproducibility. The [project] section must include name, version, requires-python, and a dependencies list with pinned versions (e.g. `numpy==2.0.2`, not `numpy>=2.0`).

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for related-work positioning and how this field frames a genuinely novel contribution.

The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Founder Fade Curve Predicts OSS Survival
hypothesis: >-
  An open-source project survives its founder stepping away if and only if the founder's involvement in the project followed
  a smooth, prolonged fade — a gradually declining trajectory, measurable as the slope of the founder's month-by-month share
  of merges, commits, and code-review decisions over the project's life — rather than an abrupt cliff or a flat plateau that
  ends suddenly. Specifically, the SHAPE of the founder's involvement trajectory over the entire pre-departure window predicts
  post-departure survival better than any static snapshot measure (bus factor, contributor count, project age, file count,
  popularity) at the moment of departure; projects whose founder's involvement fades gradually (a 'scaffolding fade') survive,
  while those whose founder maintained high involvement up to a sudden exit — or withdrew abruptly with no transition period
  — collapse.
motivation: >-
  Open-source software underpins global critical infrastructure, yet most OSS projects depend on one or two 'truck-factor'
  developers, and roughly half of those that lose their key people do not survive. Existing research measures this risk state-by-state
  — how many key developers there are (the bus factor) or what the size and bus factor of the project are at the moment of
  departure — and finds that simple counts explain little of the variation in survival. Decision-making authority (who actually
  merges, reviews, and decides) tends to concentrate in one founder, and management literature notes that a binary handover
  framing misses the empirically observed reality that most founders remain partially involved for an extended time. This
  hypothesis imports an established educational mechanism — Vygotsky/Bruner 'scaffolding with fading,' where a teacher gradually
  withdraws support as learners internalize the necessary skill — into OSS sustainability as a quantitative predictor: a slow
  founder fade signals that contributors are being scaffolded into caretaker capability, whereas a cliff leaves the contributor
  base unprepared. If confirmed, the finding would shift OSS risk assessment from snapshot metrics toward the temporal trajectory
  of decision-sharing, suggesting that maintainers should consciously decay their involvement as a survival practice and that
  ecosystem funders should evaluate trajectories rather than headcounts when triaging at-risk projects.
assumptions:
- >-
  The founder of an OSS project can be reliably identified from repository history as the user with the earliest sustained
  commit/merge activity (typically the repository creator), separable from other early 'key developers'.
- >-
  A project's survival after founder departure is a meaningful, labelable binary judgment — operationalized as continued sustained
  development activity (commits/merges above a threshold over the post-departure window) — analogous to Avelino et al.'s 'surviving
  system' criterion (attraction of at least one new truck-factor developer within the inactive period).
- >-
  The founder's involvement trajectory is meaningfully extractable from public repository artifacts: commit authorship, PR
  merges, and code-review participation, including the founder's SHARE of each over rolling time windows.
- >-
  The 'scaffolding fade' mechanism acts through capability transfer to contributors — gradual decline in the founder's share
  of merges/reviews gives contributors time to internalize decision-making skill — separable from passive 'bus factor' growth.
- >-
  A sufficient sample of public OSS projects with a founder who actually departs, with both survival and collapse outcomes,
  is obtainable from GitHub (on the order of tens to low hundreds of projects), fitting within the budget for cloning and
  parsing repository history.
investigation_approach: >-
  Assemble a curated cohort of public GitHub OSS projects whose identified founder has departed (defined by a 12-month inactivity
  window consistent with the abandonment-threshold literature). For each project, clone the repository locally and extract,
  per month or quarter from inception to founder departure, the founder's share of commits, share of PR merges, and share
  of code-review decisions; fit each trajectory to a small family of shape descriptors (linear slope, convexity, time-to-onset-of-decline,
  abrupt-cliff indicator, plateau-then-cliff indicator) and a quantitative 'fade index' (e.g., normalized integral over time).
  Independently label each project's survival using the Avelino et al. (2019) criterion — new active truck-factor developer(s)
  appearing after the founder's inactivity window with sustained subsequent activity — or, where labels are ambiguous, fall
  back on a continuous survival metric (e.g., normalized commit volume in the 24-month post-departure window relative to pre-departure
  baseline). Then build predictive models that compare (a) static baseline features (bus factor, contributor count, age, popularity,
  file count, computed at departure) against (b) the founder fade-curve shape descriptors, on both the binary survival label
  and the continuous post-departure activity retention. Use logistic regression and survival analysis (lifelines) for primary
  identification; complement with permutation-based feature importance and train/test splits. As a falsification control,
  run the same analysis using the fade curve of a randomly selected non-founder high-activity contributor in each project,
  expecting it to have lower predictive power than the founder fade curve if the mechanism is founder-specific.
success_criteria: >-
  Supporting evidence would be: (1) the founder-involvement fade descriptors significantly outperform static features (bus
  factor, contributor count, age, popularity) in cross-validated AUC/R-squared on predicting project survival after departure,
  with the fade-slope and abrupt-cliff indicator emerging as dominant feature importances; (2) a clear directional effect
  — projects whose founder involvement declined smoothly over time before departure are markedly more likely to survive than
  those whose founders maintained a flat plateau or ended with an abrupt cliff — with effect size stable across alternative
  inactivity thresholds and survival definitions; (3) the fade curve of the FOUNDER predicts survival better than the fade
  curve of a randomly chosen equally active non-founder contributor (founder-specific mechanism). Disconfirming evidence would
  be: fade descriptors add no measurable predictive value above static features, the directional effect reverses or is null
  after controlling for project age/popularity, or non-founder fade curves predict just as well (mechanism is generic, not
  founder-specific).

  Avelino, Constantinou, Valente & Serebrenik (2019) 'On the abandonment and survival of open source projects: An empirical
  investigation' — Defines truck-factor-developer detachment (TFDD) and identifies surviving systems via the arrival of new
  truck-factor developers; comparisons use STATIC factors (number of developers/commits/files, project age) measured at the
  TFDD date and find weak separation. This hypothesis fundamentally differs by modeling the DYNAMIC TRAJECTORY of the FOUNDER's
  involvement over the whole pre-departure lifespan (gradual fade vs. abrupt cliff), not a static snapshot at the moment of
  detachment, and by singling out the founder rather than the anonymous set of key developers.

  across 637 repositories over time, characterizing institutional maturation. This hypothesis differs in MODALITY (it models
  the founder's behavioral trajectory in code/merge/decision artifacts rather than textual constitution artifacts), in OUTCOME
  (it predicts survival after departure rather than documenting governance evolution), and in MECHANISM (a specific measurable
  fade curve as a predictor, not documented policy growth).

  — Post-mortem analysis of aggregate PR workflow signals (friction, backlog growth, falling innovation, rising merge latency)
  across inactive vs. active GitHub projects, identifying a 'death spiral' and finding popularity/innovation are causes of
  survival while workflow friction is a byproduct. It models COMMUNITY-level aggregate dynamics AFTER decline begins and explicitly
  does not analyze the founder. This hypothesis models the FOUNDER-SPECIFIC involvement trajectory BEFORE departure and predicts
  survival-before-decline, a complementary mechanism not considered.

  Activity? A Quasi-Experiment' — Uses Difference-in-Differences across 50,804 repositories to estimate the impact of core
  contributor disengagement on PR throughput/acceptance/merge time, finding impact varies with STATIC contributor profile
  (commit-share, tenure). This hypothesis differs by predicting whether the project SURVIVES the departure (not just its post-departure
  throughput decline), by focusing on the FOUNDER specifically, and crucially by using the dynamic trajectory of the founder's
  involvement across the whole project life as the predictor rather than a static profile at the moment of disengagement.

  classify OSS projects into lifecycle stages, with zero mention of founders or succession. This hypothesis differs by using
  a transparent, low-parameter fade-curve descriptor tied to ONE identified founder's involvement share across the project's
  full lifespan and targeting a distinct outcome (survival across an actual founder departure event).
- >-
  Vygotsky (1978) / Wood, Bruner & Ross (1976) scaffolding theory with fading — well-established educational mechanism: the
  more capable tutor provides structured support and gradually withdraws it (fading) so the learner internalizes and operates
  independently; sudden removal of support before competence matures causes collapse. The cross-domain transfer to OSS — treating
  the founder's involvement as scaffolding and predicting project post-departure survival from the shape of the fade — has
  not been previously operationalized in the OSS sustainability literature.
- >-
  Management literature on founder-CEO succession (e.g., Haveman et al. on organizational succession; Honjo & Kato 2022 on
  founder-CEO succession and firm survival; the observation that founder-CEOs often remain partially involved for some time)
  — studies binary outcomes of who succeeds and firm survival, not specifically the gradualness of involvement fade. The OSS
  adaptation here measures the actual trajectory shape continuously across behavioral artifacts, in a domain with public,
  fine-grained per-developer time series that firms do not expose.
inspiration: >-
  The Phase-1 divergence brainstorm covered eight cross-field directions (ecological succession, institutional path-dependence,
  tacit/explicit knowledge externalization, game-theoretic exit-threat credibility, structural-hole brokering, critical-slowing-down
  early warnings, allostatic load, and heterosis/cognitive diversity) — searches showed each was effectively present in OSS
  sustainability literature or recombination of existing approaches. The version that survived adversarial novelty checks
  imports the established educational mechanism of 'scaffolding with fading' (Vygotsky, Wood–Bruner–Ross) into OSS sustainability:
  just as a tutor must fade support gradually for a learner to internalize the skill, a founder must fade involvement gradually
  for the contributor community to take on decision-making; an abrupt withdrawal leaves the community unsupported and the
  project collapse-prone. The specific transfer is from the controlled-learning dynamic of tuition, where the role of 'more
  capable peer' has been formalized, to the distributed, unstructured OSS setting where no one has previously operationalized
  the founder's incremental-detachment trajectory as a survival predictor. Newer management-research observations (e.g., most
  founders stay partially involved for some time) hint at the empirical reality but in this OSS form the trajectory has not
  been measured or used as a predictor.
terms:
- term: Founder (OSS)
  definition: >-
    The principal early developer of the project, operationally defined for this study as the user with the earliest sustained
    commit/merge activity on the repository, typically the repository creator — distinguished from later key developers.
- term: Founder involvement trajectory
  definition: >-
    The time series of the founder's share of project activity per rolling time window (month or quarter) over the entire
    pre-departure lifespan, measured across multiple channels: commits authored, PR merges executed, and code-review decisions
    participated in.
- term: Fade curve / Scaffolding fade
  definition: >-
    The shape descriptor of the founder involvement trajectory — whether the founder's share declines smoothly over a sustained
    period ('scaffolding fade'), remains a flat plateau that ends abruptly ('plateau-then-cliff'), drops sharply ('abrupt
    cliff'), or oscillates — operationalized as slope, convexity, time-to-onset-of-decline, plateau-then-cliff indicator,
    and a composite fade index bounded between 0 (abrupt) and 1 (smooth fade).
- term: Scaffolding with fading
  definition: >-
    An educational-psychology principle (Vygotsky 1978; Wood, Bruner & Ross 1976) in which a more capable tutor provides structured
    support that is gradually withdrawn ('fading') as the learner internalizes the necessary skill; abrupt removal prior to
    competence causes collapse.
- term: Truck factor / Bus factor
  definition: >-
    The minimal number of developers whose simultaneous departure would seriously impair an OSS project (Williams & Cockwell;
    Cosentino et al.); a snapshot measure of how concentrated key project knowledge is.
- term: Truck-factor-developer detachment (TFDD)
  definition: >-
    Per Avelino et al. (2019), the event in which all truck-factor developers of a project become inactive within a defined
    abandonment window; a 'surviving system' is one where active new truck-factor developers subsequently appear.
- term: Survival after founder departure
  definition: >-
    A label for whether the project continues sustained development activity (commits/merges above a baseline threshold) over
    a defined post-departure window; operationally continued activity indicates survival, fall to inactivity indicates collapse.
summary: >-
  Whether an OSS project survives its founder stepping away is determined not by how many people there are at the moment of
  departure, but by the SHAPE of how the founder's involvement evolved across the project's whole life — smooth gradual decline
  ('scaffolding fade') signals a community prepared to take over and predicts survival; an abrupt cliff or unbroken plateau-then-cliff
  predicts collapse.

title: Methodology Grounding for Founder Fade Research
summary: >-
  This research establishes the methodological foundation for studying founder involvement trajectories and OSS project survival.
  It synthesizes findings from the foundational Avelino et al. (2019) study on Truck Factor Developer Detachment (TFDD), its
  2025 large-scale replication by Nourry et al., and practical GitHub data extraction protocols. Key findings: (1) TFDD occurs
  when ALL truck-factor developers abandon a project, with a 1-year inactivity threshold providing the best precision-improvement
  tradeoff; (2) Among 1,932 popular projects, 16% faced TFDD and 41% survived; among 36,464 projects of all sizes, 89.6% faced
  TFDD but only 27% survived — revealing that smaller projects are far more fragile; (3) Surviving projects tend to be younger
  at TFDD time, have more post-TFDD commits, and often attract a single new core developer (86% of survivals); (4) GitHub
  data extraction is feasible via REST/GraphQL APIs for commits, merges, and reviews, but GH Archive BigQuery lacks PullRequestReviewEvent
  data; (5) Founder identification should combine repository creation metadata with earliest sustained contribution patterns;
  (6) Recommended statistical models include Cox Proportional Hazards for time-to-survival analysis and logistic regression
  for binary survival outcomes, controlling for project age, star count, contributor diversity, and file count.

  Implemented a full comparative experiment evaluating whether temporal fade curve descriptors of founder involvement outperform

  (smooth fade, abrupt cliff, plateau-then-cliff). Computed 6 fade descriptors: linear slope, convexity, decline onset time,
  cliff score, plateau indicator, and composite fade index. Trained 4 models: (A) Static-only Logistic Regression (AUC=1.000),
  (B) Fade-only Logistic Regression (AUC=0.909), (C) Combined Logistic Regression (AUC=0.994), (D) Ridge regression for continuous

  static features (bus_factor=0.030, stars=0.024) dominate over fade descriptors. Point-biserial correlation confirmed positive
  relationship between fade_idx and survival (r=0.646, p<0.001). Falsification control (shuffled fade features) confirmed

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Do NOT emit your structured output when the draft is done — TODO 5 is a
separate revision pass that runs over the finished draft first.
TODO 5. REVISION PASS — start this ONLY once TODO 4's draft is complete, and treat it as a distinct
pass over the finished text rather than something folded into the writing. Read
`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md` in the aii-paper-writing skill's own directory and apply every item to the
full draft.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done at the same time. The defects that
checklist targets — prose denser than the field needs, an abstract dumped full of numbers, sections
that leak into one another, a Figure 1 that shows a side result instead of the main idea, close
prior work that only the draft's FINAL vocabulary would have surfaced, a study of N things that
plots eight of them, section names that mean nothing to someone who has not read the section,
implementation filenames cited in the prose, numbers that disagree between the abstract, the text
and the tables — are all invisible while drafting, because you are holding your intent rather than
the text. Every one is obvious to the first outside reader.

Work the items one at a time against the ACTUAL text, not from memory of what you meant to write.
For each item, either fix the draft or state in one line why it already holds. The checklist's
consistency section is several SEPARATE sweeps of the whole paper, one concern per sweep — run them
that way, and repeat any sweep that produced an edit, since a fix in one place routinely breaks
agreement somewhere else. Expect this pass to change the draft; one that produces no edits was not
really run.

Only when the checklist is fully worked through, emit the structured JSON — that is your ONLY
output. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate image/figure files at any point.

The agent loaded the **aii-paper-writing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````

name: aii-paper-writing
description: "Writes the PROSE of an AI research paper: abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, discussion and conclusion, with a page budget, the 5-paragraph intro pattern, writing-quality rules, inline [FIGURE:fig_id] markers plus a structured figures array, and a MANDATORY REVISION_CHECKLIST.md pass over every finished draft. Use whenever a paper, abstract, section, or full write-up is being drafted or rewritten for a venue such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR or ACL. Triggers: write a paper, paper structure, abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, contributions, figure caption and placement, revision pass, academic prose. NOT for: assembling or compiling .tex (use aii-paper-to-latex), rendering the figure image files (aii-data-fig-gen, aii-concept-fig-gen), fetching BibTeX (use aii-semscholar-bib), or critiquing a finished draft's logic (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## MANDATORY: the final revision pass

**`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`, in this skill's own directory, MUST be read and
applied to every finished draft, always, as a separate pass after the writing
is done.** It is not optional, not conditional on how the draft looks, and not
something to fold into the writing itself.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done in one pass. The
defects that checklist targets — dense prose, a number-dumped abstract, sections
that leak into each other, a Figure 1 that shows a side result, prior work the
final vocabulary would have found, results mentioned but never plotted,
inconsistencies between abstract and tables — are all invisible while drafting,
because the author is holding the intent rather than the text. Every one of them
is obvious to the first outside reader. Reading the checklist before writing
does not substitute: the pass has to run against a finished draft.

So the order is always: write the complete draft → read `REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`
→ work its items against the full text, fixing as you go → only then emit the
output.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

description: "Fetches real BibTeX entries in one batch from Semantic Scholar by DOI, ArXiv ID or title via aii_semscholar_bib__fetch, normalises citation keys to AuthorYYYY, injects DOIs, and writes the result into references.bib, with a mandatory web-search fallback for anything not found. ALWAYS use whenever a bibliography, reference list or .bib file is being built or extended, and whenever a citation needs a verified entry instead of an invented one — never hand-write BibTeX first. Triggers: bibliography, references.bib, bibtex, citation key, DOI, arXiv id, Semantic Scholar, reference list, cite these papers, natbib entries. NOT for: writing the text around the citations (use aii-paper-writing), running bibtex and compiling (use aii-paper-to-latex), judging whether cited work supports the claims (use amg-paper-verification), or open-ended literature search and PDF mining (use aii-web-tools)."
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

---

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[

  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"

---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

name: aii-openrouter-llms
description: "Searches the OpenRouter model catalog and calls any text model in it (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, Grok) from the command line, with temperature, reasoning effort, system instructions, multi-turn JSON input, web search, and model-specific extra params. Use whenever a task or script needs a third-party LLM invoked or benchmarked against others, a model picked by cost or context length, or per-million-token pricing and supported parameters looked up. Triggers: OpenRouter, call an LLM, compare or evaluate models, model pricing, cost per million tokens, context length, reasoning effort, temperature, which model is best, provider/model-name identifiers. NOT for: image generation or editing through OpenRouter (use aii-concept-fig-gen), plain web search or page fetching (use aii-web-tools), or Anthropic-API specifics of this repo's own Claude usage (use claude-api)."

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase model discovery and calling)
- Scripts (Search, Get Params, Call)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: Model Discovery and Calling

### Phase 1: Search for Models
Find models with pricing, context length, and descriptions
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py "claude" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2 (optional): Get Model Parameters
Check what parameters a specific model supports
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
```

### Phase 3: Call Model
Call a model using the API name from search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py --model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" --input "What is 2+2?"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OpenRouter models (aii_or_search_llms.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py "claude" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --limit 5' ::: 'claude' 'gpt' 'gemini'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 models for query: claude

[1] Anthropic: Claude Opus 4.5
    API: anthropic/claude-opus-4.5
    Context: 200,000 tokens
    Price: $5.00/M in, $25.00/M out
    Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's frontier reasoning model...

[2] Anthropic: Claude Haiku 4.5
    API: anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
    Context: 200,000 tokens
    Price: $1.00/M in, $5.00/M out
    ...
```

**Parameters:**

`query` (optional, positional)
- Search query to filter models (e.g., 'claude', 'gpt', 'reasoning')

`--timeout` (optional)
- Request timeout in seconds (default: 60)

**Tips:**
- Use the `API` field from results for the `--model` parameter in calls
- Search is fast (queries OpenRouter's model list)

---

### Get model parameters (aii_or_get_llm_params.py)

Get detailed information and supported parameters for a specific model.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
```

**Parallel execution (multiple models):**

IMPORTANT: When checking multiple models, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {}' ::: 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5' 'openai/gpt-4o-mini' 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
```

**Example output:**

- Model API name (e.g., 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5', 'openai/o1')

`--timeout` (optional)
- Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)

**Tips:**
- Use after search to see which parameters a model supports
- Check supported_parameters before using --reasoning or other options

---

### Call OpenRouter model (aii_or_call_llms.py)

Make an API call to an OpenRouter LLM model.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \

`--timeout` (optional)
- Request timeout in seconds (default: 120)

**Examples:**

Simple call:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" \
  --input "Write a haiku about coding" \
  --temperature 0.8
```

With system instructions:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" \
  --input "Explain recursion" \
  --instructions "You are a helpful programming tutor. Keep explanations concise."
```

With reasoning (for o1-style models):
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "openai/o1" \
  --input "Solve this complex math problem" \
  --reasoning high
```

With web search:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" \
  --input "What are the latest AI news?" \
  --web-search 10 \
  --max-tokens 15000
```

With extra model-specific params:
```bash
# Step 1: Check what params the model supports
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"
# Shows: frequency_penalty, top_k, seed, min_p, etc.

# Step 2: Call with those params
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" \
  --input "Write a short poem" \
  --params '{"top_k": 50, "seed": 42, "frequency_penalty": 0.5}'
```

---

## Tips

- Use `aii_or_search_llms.py` first to find models, then copy `API` field for `--model`
- Use `aii_or_get_llm_params.py` to check what params a model supports before using `--params`
- For web search, increase `--max-tokens` to handle larger responses (15000+)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Runs multi-source web research campaigns — literature reviews, deep cross-verification of many claims or citations, paper and PDF mining — by escalating WebSearch for discovery, WebFetch for the gist, then aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction with context windows over HTML or PDFs. Use whenever a task needs far more than a handful of lookups: comprehensive or deep research, surveying a field, cross-referencing sources against each other, or checking many references at once. Triggers: literature review, comprehensive or extensive or deep research, survey the field, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arXiv paper mining. NOT for: a single quick lookup, which raw WebSearch and WebFetch already handle; NOT for the script-level search, fetch, and grep tooling or running without built-in web tools — use aii-web-tools; NOT for fetching BibTeX into references.bib (use aii-semscholar-bib) or judging whether a draft's claims hold up (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"

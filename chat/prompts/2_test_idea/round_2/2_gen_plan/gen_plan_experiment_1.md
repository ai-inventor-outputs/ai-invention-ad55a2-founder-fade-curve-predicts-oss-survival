<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Founder Fade Curve May Complement Static Predictors of OSS Survival
hypothesis: >-
  An open-source project's post-departure survival may be enhanced by the shape of the founder's involvement trajectory, but
  this effect is likely secondary to static snapshot measures (contributor count, bus factor, project age) and requires larger-scale
  validation to confirm. Specifically, a smooth, prolonged founder fade — where the founder's share of commits, merges, and
  review decisions gradually declines over an extended pre-departure window — is hypothesized to be *complementary* to static
  features rather than superior to them. The core empirical claim is now more modest: (1) trajectory shape descriptors add
  some predictive value beyond static features in combination, rather than outperforming them alone; (2) the founder-specific
  mechanism (scaffolding fade unique to the founder's role) is not yet supported by pilot evidence and should be treated as
  an open question rather than a central prediction; (3) multi-dimensional involvement metrics (code review, architectural
  decisions, governance participation) are likely more predictive than commit share alone, and future work should incorporate
  these channels. The hypothesis is reformulated to be testable at scale with properly computed survival labels (not pre-assigned
  from public knowledge), and to acknowledge that static features already capture substantial predictive signal in small cohorts.
motivation: >-
  Open-source software underpins global critical infrastructure, yet most OSS projects depend on one or two 'truck-factor'
  developers, and roughly half of those that lose their key people do not survive. Existing research measures this risk state-by-state
  — how many key developers there are (the bus factor) or what the size and bus factor of the project are at the moment of
  departure — and finds that simple counts explain little of the variation in survival. Decision-making authority (who actually
  merges, reviews, and decides) tends to concentrate in one founder, and management literature notes that a binary handover
  framing misses the empirically observed reality that most founders remain partially involved for an extended time. This
  hypothesis imports an established educational mechanism — Vygotsky/Bruner 'scaffolding with fading,' where a teacher gradually
  withdraws support as learners internalize the necessary skill — into OSS sustainability as a quantitative predictor: a slow
  founder fade signals that contributors are being scaffolded into caretaker capability, whereas a cliff leaves the contributor
  base unprepared. If confirmed, the finding would shift OSS risk assessment from snapshot metrics toward the temporal trajectory
  of decision-sharing, suggesting that maintainers should consciously decay their involvement as a survival practice and that
  ecosystem funders should evaluate trajectories rather than headcounts when triaging at-risk projects.
assumptions:
- >-
  The founder of an OSS project can be reliably identified from repository history as the user with the earliest sustained
  commit/merge activity (typically the repository creator), separable from other early 'key developers'.
- >-
  A project's survival after founder departure is a meaningful, labelable binary judgment — operationalized as continued sustained
  development activity (commits/merges above a threshold over the post-departure window) — analogous to Avelino et al.'s 'surviving
  system' criterion (attraction of at least one new truck-factor developer within the inactive period).
- >-
  The founder's involvement trajectory is meaningfully extractable from public repository artifacts: commit authorship, PR
  merges, and code-review participation, including the founder's SHARE of each over rolling time windows.
- >-
  The 'scaffolding fade' mechanism acts through capability transfer to contributors — gradual decline in the founder's share
  of merges/reviews gives contributors time to internalize decision-making skill — separable from passive 'bus factor' growth.
- >-
  A sufficient sample of public OSS projects with a founder who actually departs, with both survival and collapse outcomes,
  is obtainable from GitHub (on the order of tens to low hundreds of projects), fitting within the budget for cloning and
  parsing repository history.
investigation_approach: >-
  Assemble a curated cohort of public GitHub OSS projects whose identified founder has departed (defined by a 12-month inactivity
  window consistent with the abandonment-threshold literature). For each project, clone the repository locally and extract,
  per month or quarter from inception to founder departure, the founder's share of commits, share of PR merges, and share
  of code-review decisions; fit each trajectory to a small family of shape descriptors (linear slope, convexity, time-to-onset-of-decline,
  abrupt-cliff indicator, plateau-then-cliff indicator) and a quantitative 'fade index' (e.g., normalized integral over time).
  Independently label each project's survival using the Avelino et al. (2019) criterion — new active truck-factor developer(s)
  appearing after the founder's inactivity window with sustained subsequent activity — or, where labels are ambiguous, fall
  back on a continuous survival metric (e.g., normalized commit volume in the 24-month post-departure window relative to pre-departure
  baseline). Then build predictive models that compare (a) static baseline features (bus factor, contributor count, age, popularity,
  file count, computed at departure) against (b) the founder fade-curve shape descriptors, on both the binary survival label
  and the continuous post-departure activity retention. Use logistic regression and survival analysis (lifelines) for primary
  identification; complement with permutation-based feature importance and train/test splits. As a falsification control,
  run the same analysis using the fade curve of a randomly selected non-founder high-activity contributor in each project,
  expecting it to have lower predictive power than the founder fade curve if the mechanism is founder-specific.
success_criteria: >-
  Supporting evidence would be: (1) the founder-involvement fade descriptors significantly outperform static features (bus
  factor, contributor count, age, popularity) in cross-validated AUC/R-squared on predicting project survival after departure,
  with the fade-slope and abrupt-cliff indicator emerging as dominant feature importances; (2) a clear directional effect
  — projects whose founder involvement declined smoothly over time before departure are markedly more likely to survive than
  those whose founders maintained a flat plateau or ended with an abrupt cliff — with effect size stable across alternative
  inactivity thresholds and survival definitions; (3) the fade curve of the FOUNDER predicts survival better than the fade
  curve of a randomly chosen equally active non-founder contributor (founder-specific mechanism). Disconfirming evidence would
  be: fade descriptors add no measurable predictive value above static features, the directional effect reverses or is null
  after controlling for project age/popularity, or non-founder fade curves predict just as well (mechanism is generic, not
  founder-specific).

  Avelino, Constantinou, Valente & Serebrenik (2019) 'On the abandonment and survival of open source projects: An empirical
  investigation' — Defines truck-factor-developer detachment (TFDD) and identifies surviving systems via the arrival of new
  truck-factor developers; comparisons use STATIC factors (number of developers/commits/files, project age) measured at the
  TFDD date and find weak separation. This hypothesis fundamentally differs by modeling the DYNAMIC TRAJECTORY of the FOUNDER's
  involvement over the whole pre-departure lifespan (gradual fade vs. abrupt cliff), not a static snapshot at the moment of
  detachment, and by singling out the founder rather than the anonymous set of key developers.

  across 637 repositories over time, characterizing institutional maturation. This hypothesis differs in MODALITY (it models

  (it predicts survival after departure rather than documenting governance evolution), and in MECHANISM (a specific measurable
  fade curve as a predictor, not documented policy growth).

  does not analyze the founder. This hypothesis models the FOUNDER-SPECIFIC involvement trajectory BEFORE departure and predicts
  survival-before-decline, a complementary mechanism not considered.

  contributor disengagement on PR throughput/acceptance/merge time, finding impact varies with STATIC contributor profile
  (commit-share, tenure). This hypothesis differs by predicting whether the project SURVIVES the departure (not just its post-departure
  throughput decline), by focusing on the FOUNDER specifically, and crucially by using the dynamic trajectory of the founder's
  involvement across the whole project life as the predictor rather than a static profile at the moment of disengagement.

  full lifespan and targeting a distinct outcome (survival across an actual founder departure event).

  Vygotsky (1978) / Wood, Bruner & Ross (1976) scaffolding theory with fading — well-established educational mechanism: the
  more capable tutor provides structured support and gradually withdraws it (fading) so the learner internalizes and operates
  independently; sudden removal of support before competence matures causes collapse. The cross-domain transfer to OSS — treating
  the founder's involvement as scaffolding and predicting project post-departure survival from the shape of the fade — has
  not been previously operationalized in the OSS sustainability literature.
- >-
  Management literature on founder-CEO succession (e.g., Haveman et al. on organizational succession; Honjo & Kato 2022 on
  founder-CEO succession and firm survival; the observation that founder-CEOs often remain partially involved for some time)
  — studies binary outcomes of who succeeds and firm survival, not specifically the gradualness of involvement fade. The OSS
  adaptation here measures the actual trajectory shape continuously across behavioral artifacts, in a domain with public,
  fine-grained per-developer time series that firms do not expose.
inspiration: >-
  The Phase-1 divergence brainstorm covered eight cross-field directions (ecological succession, institutional path-dependence,
  tacit/explicit knowledge externalization, game-theoretic exit-threat credibility, structural-hole brokering, critical-slowing-down
  early warnings, allostatic load, and heterosis/cognitive diversity) — searches showed each was effectively present in OSS
  sustainability literature or recombination of existing approaches. The version that survived adversarial novelty checks
  imports the established educational mechanism of 'scaffolding with fading' (Vygotsky, Wood–Bruner–Ross) into OSS sustainability:
  just as a tutor must fade support gradually for a learner to internalize the skill, a founder must fade involvement gradually
  for the contributor community to take on decision-making; an abrupt withdrawal leaves the community unsupported and the
  project collapse-prone. The specific transfer is from the controlled-learning dynamic of tuition, where the role of 'more
  capable peer' has been formalized, to the distributed, unstructured OSS setting where no one has previously operationalized
  the founder's incremental-detachment trajectory as a survival predictor. Newer management-research observations (e.g., most
  founders stay partially involved for some time) hint at the empirical reality but in this OSS form the trajectory has not
  been measured or used as a predictor.
terms:
- term: Founder (OSS)
  definition: >-
    The principal early developer of the project, operationally defined for this study as the user with the earliest sustained
    commit/merge activity on the repository, typically the repository creator — distinguished from later key developers.
- term: Founder involvement trajectory
  definition: >-
    The time series of the founder's share of project activity per rolling time window (month or quarter) over the entire
    pre-departure lifespan, measured across multiple channels: commits authored, PR merges executed, and code-review decisions
    participated in.
- term: Fade curve / Scaffolding fade
  definition: >-
    The shape descriptor of the founder involvement trajectory — whether the founder's share declines smoothly over a sustained
    period ('scaffolding fade'), remains a flat plateau that ends abruptly ('plateau-then-cliff'), drops sharply ('abrupt
    cliff'), or oscillates — operationalized as slope, convexity, time-to-onset-of-decline, plateau-then-cliff indicator,
    and a composite fade index bounded between 0 (abrupt) and 1 (smooth fade).
- term: Scaffolding with fading
  definition: >-
    An educational-psychology principle (Vygotsky 1978; Wood, Bruner & Ross 1976) in which a more capable tutor provides structured
    support that is gradually withdrawn ('fading') as the learner internalizes the necessary skill; abrupt removal prior to
    competence causes collapse.
- term: Truck factor / Bus factor
  definition: >-
    The minimal number of developers whose simultaneous departure would seriously impair an OSS project (Williams & Cockwell;
    Cosentino et al.); a snapshot measure of how concentrated key project knowledge is.
- term: Truck-factor-developer detachment (TFDD)
  definition: >-
    Per Avelino et al. (2019), the event in which all truck-factor developers of a project become inactive within a defined
    abandonment window; a 'surviving system' is one where active new truck-factor developers subsequently appear.
- term: Survival after founder departure
  definition: >-
    A label for whether the project continues sustained development activity (commits/merges above a baseline threshold) over
    a defined post-departure window; operationally continued activity indicates survival, fall to inactivity indicates collapse.
summary: >-
  Whether an OSS project survives its founder stepping away is determined not by how many people there are at the moment of
  departure, but by the SHAPE of how the founder's involvement evolved across the project's whole life — smooth gradual decline
  ('scaffolding fade') signals a community prepared to take over and predicts survival; an abrupt cliff or unbroken plateau-then-cliff
  predicts collapse.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Evolution: keeping trajectory frame but dropping superiority and founder-specificity claims per null pilot results
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Dropped claim that fade curve 'outperforms' static measures; reframed as potentially complementary predictor
- >-
  Founder-specific mechanism claim downgraded from central prediction to open question (falsification control found no founder-specific
  effect)
- >-
  Added emphasis on multi-dimensional involvement metrics (reviews, governance, architectural decisions) beyond commit share
- >-
  Acknowledged that static features already achieve strong prediction (AUC=0.857) and trajectory effects may only emerge at
  larger scale

id: experiment_iter2_dir1
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Scale the founder fade curve analysis to a cohort of 100+ GitHub projects with properly computed TFDD survival labels, a
  corrected falsification control, and bootstrap confidence intervals. Compute survival labels from actual repository activity
  data using the Avelino et al. (2019) TFDD framework (12-month inactivity threshold, 50% activity retention criterion) rather
  than pre-assigned labels. Extract founder involvement trajectories (monthly commit share, merge share, review share) for
  each project. Implement a proper falsification control: for each project, select 3 random non-founder contributors matched
  on pre-departure activity level (same monthly commit share range) and compute their fade descriptors — comparing founder
  vs. matched non-founder predictive performance tests the founder-specific mechanism. Train logistic regression and Cox PH
  models with leave-one-out cross-validation and bootstrap 95% CIs for AUC estimates. Run sensitivity analysis varying the
  inactivity threshold (6, 12, 18 months) and survival definition (binary vs. continuous retention ratio). Report all data
  extraction failures and label discrepancies transparently.
approach: >-
  Start from the existing 14,428-repo dataset (art_oy-M28PzQPWY) as a candidate pool. Filter for repos with age > 24 months,
  contributor count >= 5, stars >= 10, and primary language in {Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby} — yielding roughly 2,000-3,000
  candidates. For each candidate, query the GitHub REST API to (1) list contributors ordered by commit count, (2) identify
  the founder as the contributor with the earliest first-commit date among top contributors, (3) extract the founder's per-month
  commit timeline, (4) check for a 12-month contiguous inactivity window (founder departure), and (5) compute post-departure
  activity metrics for TFDD survival labeling: count unique non-founder contributors active in each post-departure month,
  compute the post-departure commit rate relative to pre-departure baseline, and label SURVIVE if at least one new contributor
  accumulates >= 20% of post-departure commit share (truck-factor criterion) or if the project maintains >= 50% of pre-departure
  commit rate for >= 3 consecutive months. For projects with computed founder departure, extract per-month founder involvement
  shares across three channels: commits (git log or API /contributors endpoint), PR merges (API /pulls endpoint with merged_by
  field), and code reviews (API /pulls/{number}/reviews endpoint). Compute trajectory shape descriptors (slope via Theil-Sen,
  convexity via quadratic fit, onset of decline via PELT change-point detection, cliff indicator, plateau-then-cliff indicator,
  fade index) using validated methods from prior iterations. For the falsification control, select 3 random non-founder contributors
  per project from those active in the same pre-departure period, matched on mean pre-departure monthly commit share (within
  +/- 5 percentage points), and compute their fade descriptors using the same pipeline. Build the feature matrix and train
  logistic regression with LOOCV, reporting AUC with bootstrap 95% CI (1,000 resamples). Fit Cox PH model with lifelines and
  report concordance with CI. Compute permutation feature importance. Run sensitivity analysis on inactivity thresholds (6,
  12, 18 months) and report how AUC changes. Use multiprocessing for parallel API queries. Target 100-150 projects with valid
  computed labels. Log every extraction failure and label discrepancy. Budget GitHub API calls efficiently: batch metadata
  queries, cache results, use pagination. No git cloning for full repos — use API endpoints exclusively for efficiency.

title: GitHub OSS Repos for Founder Fade Study
summary: >-
  This artifact provides a curated dataset of 14,428 public GitHub OSS repositories from the h1alexbel/github-repos collection
  (MIT license, collected via ghminer tool). Each record contains repo-level features: full repo name, branch, description,
  topics, creation date, last commit date, contributor count, PR count, commit count, issue count, fork count, star count,
  disk usage, license, and primary language. A proxy survival label (ACTIVE/INACTIVE) is computed based on contributor count
  and activity ratio, serving as a baseline for the Founder Fade hypothesis that the shape of founder involvement decline
  predicts project survival. The dataset spans multiple ecosystems (JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, etc.) and includes
  repositories of varying sizes and ages. Downstream experiments will use this as a candidate pool to identify repos with
  departed founders, then extract time-series founder involvement trajectories via GitHub API and git log parsing. The dataset
  is organized in exp_sel_data_out.json schema format with 5-fold stratified cross-validation splits.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: free-first web search (general or scholarly, Serper fallback), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

name: aii-python
description: Python coding standards for experiment and evaluation scripts. Covers environment setup, logging, error handling, and code structure.
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

name: aii-parallel-computing
description: "CRITICAL PERFORMANCE SKILL. Maximize hardware utilization for compute-intensive tasks. Covers GPU acceleration, CPU parallelism, and async I/O. The difference between hours of failure and minutes of success. Use whenever writing ANY script that processes data, makes API calls, or does computation."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: Gradual scaling pattern for long-running autonomous tasks. Use when running experiments, evaluations, or any code that processes data at increasing scale with runtime checks.
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

name: aii-use-hardware
description: Detect hardware and use it responsibly. Covers CPU/RAM/GPU detection, memory-safe data processing, and resource-aware computation.
---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle
